# configure-queue

A flexible, token-based queue management system built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts.

## Overview

Configure Queue is a decentralized smart contract system that enables dynamic, token-prioritized task queuing. By leveraging blockchain technology, it provides a transparent, fair, and configurable mechanism for managing complex workflow scenarios across various domains.

## Core Features

- **Dynamic Queue Management**: Create and configure queues with flexible parameters
- **Token-Based Prioritization**: Use tokens to influence queue positioning and access
- **Resource Allocation**: Intelligent task distribution and management
- **Transparent Tracking**: Immutable queue state and participant interactions

## Smart Contract Architecture

### Queue Manager (`queue-manager`)
- Implements core queue management logic
- Handles queue creation, configuration, and state tracking
- Manages participant interactions and token-based prioritization
- Provides extensible framework for custom queue implementations

## Key Functions

### Queue Configuration
```clarity
;; Create a new queue
(create-queue 
  (queue-name (string-ascii 64)) 
  (max-participants uint) 
  (priority-token principal)
)

;; Update queue parameters
(configure-queue 
  (queue-name (string-ascii 64)) 
  (new-config (tuple))
)
```

### Queue Participation
```clarity
;; Join a queue
(enqueue 
  (queue-name (string-ascii 64)) 
  (participant principal)
)

;; Leave a queue
(dequeue 
  (queue-name (string-ascii 64)) 
  (participant principal)
)

;; Advance queue state
(process-queue 
  (queue-name (string-ascii 64))
)
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies for Clarity development
3. Deploy the contract to the Stacks blockchain
4. Interact with the queue management functions

## Security Considerations

- Immutable queue state tracking
- Role-based access controls
- Token-based prioritization mechanisms
- Transparent queue management
- Prevention of queue manipulation
